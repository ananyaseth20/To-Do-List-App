# My Personal Project

## To-Do List Application

##### What will the application do? <br>
My project is a to-do list application/ task manager that allows you to:
 - *add* items to a to-do list
 - *remove* items from a to-do list
 - *sort* the items into categories
 - *arrange* items according to their due dates


##### Who will use it? Why is this project of interest to you? <br>
Everyone! This application is for anyone that wants to be more organized in their daily life- it is of special interest to me because I always feel like I have a hard time keeping track of deadlines and unfortunately, sometimes, my work can suffer because of it. I think if I have a task manager application, I will be able to focus on what's important.
